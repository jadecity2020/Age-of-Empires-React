## Project Description

For this project, I plan to make a multiple-choice trivia game. I will use React's Link and Source to provide access to instructions, the game itself, and a leaderboard. The questions and possible answers will be populated using an API call. The leaderboard will be stored on a Google Sheet and also viewed through an API call.

## API

https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/civilizations


```
{
"civilizations": [
{
"id": 1,
"name": "Aztecs",
"expansion": "The Conquerors",
"army_type": "Infantry and Monk",
"unique_unit": [
"https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/unit/jaguar_warrior"
],
"unique_tech": [
"https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/technology/garland_wars"
],
"team_bonus": "Relics generate +33% gold",
"civilization_bonus": [
"Villagers carry +5",
"Military units created 15% faster",
"+5 Monk hit points for each Monastery technology",
"Loom free"
]
},
```

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min


#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Detailed Introduction on the game "Age of Empires II" 
- Navbar with options that link to their corresponding pages
- Implementing at least 10 civilizations (out of a total of 18)
- Application of API calls on the corresponding pages


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Implement all 18 civilizations


## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
Haven't edit this portion but left here as reference
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | Sets up app with React Router | 
| Header | Renders the header, including the nav | 
| Footer | Renders the footer |
| Main | Contains Switch/Routes for content |
| Gameboard | Renders the trivia game, contains score as state |
| Question | Renders current question via API call and Answer components |
| Answer | Renders a possible answer using props from Question |
| Score | Renders player's score received through props |
| HighScore | Form that renders at end of game if the player achieves a high score |
| Options | Renders a form of selectable game options |
| Instructions | Renders rules and info about the game |
| Leaderboard | Renders list of top scorers via API call |

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
